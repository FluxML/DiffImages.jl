# DiffImages: Extending Automatic Differentiation support to the JuliaImages ecosystem

DiffImages.jl is a differentiable computer vision library made in pure Julia. It is being developed with the aim of extending AD support to the JuliaImages ecosystem. 

This library is under heavy development and is not intended for use yet. A stable release later will enable the users to readily use this.

You can watch our development at the Discussions tab of our repository. We welcome all and everyone who intend to help us with their discussions. Open Source code simply cannot be made if the community does not give its inputs.

We hope you remain safe and healthy.
